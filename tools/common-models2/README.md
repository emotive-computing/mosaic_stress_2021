# COMMON MODELS REDESIGN

Welcome!
This is the repository for the Machine Learning Library used within the Emotive Computing Lab. 

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Make sure you are using python 3.7+.  We suggest using a separate virtual environment for installation. For example, if you are using Anaconda:
```
conda create --name cm2 python=3.7
```
will create an environment named *cm2*.  Next, install the package using pip inside the root folder of the repository:
```
pip install .
```

## MAC INSTALLATION
*Installation has only been tested on Mac M1 Silicon *
### Mac M1 Silicon Installation Steps:
1. Install Xcode from the App Store or you can download it from the Developer site.
2. Install the Command Line Tools Package on Terminal using: `xcode-select --install`

*The Command Line Tools Package is a small self-contained package available for download separately from Xcode and that allows you to do command line development in macOS.*
